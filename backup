                    <p class="about-metext">Hi, my name is, my name is, my name is, chiki chiki Mel Dee. About myself? hmm? I love to salsa, bachata, Kizommba and Zouk dance. The most challenging thing about dancing is the learning curve. You can't practice partner dancing on your own. Most people do not have personal practice partners ready to work with them at thier leisure. One of my goals is to build a site so dancers who would like to improve their skills can find partners to work with all over the world. Most importantly, what an anticlamctic end to the story of the night king and "winter is coming." So lame how GOT chose to conclude the existential threat storyline. BOOOO! </p>
